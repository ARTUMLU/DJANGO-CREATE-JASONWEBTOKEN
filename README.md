Welcome to My Project! This is a simple Django project that demonstrates how to implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) authentication in a RESTful API.

Introduction
JWT (JSON Web Token) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

Purpose of JWT
JWT is commonly used for authentication and information exchange in web applications. It allows clients to authenticate themselves and access protected resources on a server after successful login.

How JWT Works
Authentication: When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT token and sends it back to the client.

Authorization: The client includes the JWT token in subsequent requests as a bearer token in the Authorization header.

Verification: The server validates the JWT token to ensure its authenticity and integrity. If the token is valid and not expired, the server grants access to the requested resource.

Benefits of JWT
Stateless: JWTs are stateless, meaning server-side storage of session data is not required. This reduces the load on the server and improves scalability.

Compact: JWTs are compact and can be easily transmitted over the network as URL parameters, HTTP headers, or within the request body.

Secure: JWTs can be digitally signed to ensure data integrity and authenticity. This prevents tampering and unauthorized access to the token contents.

Getting Started
To use JWT authentication in your Django project, you can install the djangorestframework_simplejwt package. Detailed installation and usage instructions can be found in the official documentation: djangorestframework_simplejwt Documentation.
